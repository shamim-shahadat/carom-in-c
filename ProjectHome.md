This game is basically a modification of famous carrom game. In this I have used only simple basic graphics functions available in C to move and hit the balls,and everything goes according to the rules of collision.
Work on this project started in June 2009 and i finished it in about 1 month.
To run this game you have to open this code file with Turbo-C compiler and then press Ctrl-F9 to run.
Now play the game and have fun!
